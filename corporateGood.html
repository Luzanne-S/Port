        <h1>Corporate Givers</h1>
        <p>
         This project was created for a hackathon; Hack for Humanity from the Universtity of Arizona, that I participated in. My role was to be a researcher, ux and ui designer. The timeframe from creating a concept to presentation was 48 hours.
          Hack for humanity posed the question as to how to encourage civic
          engagment:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="corporateQuote">
          "Research and lived experience show that voting, belonging to an
          organization, and volunteering can positively impact an individual’s
          physical and mental health for the individual. Yet participation in
          these activities fluctuates and differs widely among societies across
          the globe."
        </blockquote>
        <br />
            <br />
       
        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500"> 
          <h2>Challenge Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Productive Civic Engagement within the corporate world: currently,
            corporations and working individuals lack free time and flexible
            schedules to participate in volunteer work.
            <br />
            <br />We bridge the gap between companies/employees and
            volunteer/charitable activities through our app, which connects them
            to local/global (paid-time off) volunteering events/activities that
            both match their schedules and provide them the fulfillment of
            contributing/connecting with their community.

                    <p>The mind map created to explore the concept. By identifying similar ideas, gaps for improvement, ways in which the project could improve the lives of individuals and corporations and ways to differentiate ourselves from any competitors.</p>

        <!--User Audience-->
    <section class="corporateAudience corporate-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
      <h2>User Audience</h2>
      <h3>Who</h3>
      <p>
        Our app would target partnerships with corporations (small business
        specifically) to build incentives for employees that volunteer (such as
        paid time off), encouraging a pool of new individuals who don’t often
        volunteer to join volunteering/charitable activities.
      </p>
      <h3>Why</h3>
      <h4>Corporations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;
          Encourage participation in volunteer/charitable work → increases
          company productivity, satisfaction, and morale (strengthening company
          brand)
        </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;
          Faster more efficient volunteer/Charity planning for corporations
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Charities and Non Profits</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;
          Addressing resource limitations, improving project delivery, get the
          help they need from volunteers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Employees</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;
          Connecting with their community, building mental/physical
          health/happiness, sense of fulfillment + social networking
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
        <!--Humanity Principles-->
    <section class="corporateImpact corporate-text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
      <h2>The solution should encompass at least three of the Humanity principles:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Compassion </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Empathy </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Respect </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Integrity </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Forgiveness </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Self-reflection</li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Kindness</li>
    </section>
        <!--Customer Segment-->
    <section class="corporateReach corporate-text"data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
      <h2>Customer Segment</h2>
      <p>We are targeting small to large corporations (customers), as well as their employees (user). We will also partner with nonprofits and organizers for charitable events to compile our volunteer events or activities database for customers to use during their searches.</p>
      <h2>Reaching the Audience</h2>
      <p>To reach out audience, we plan to reach out to local charities and event organizers to gather information about upcoming events and activities. Then, we will reach out to small businesses, as they are less likely to be invovled in civic activity and engagement due to lack of resources and funding that large corporations currently have. </p>

    </section>
        <!--Summary of the Solution-->
    <section class="Summary-Solution corporate-text"data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
      <h2>Summary of the Solution</h2>
      <p>We bridge the gap between companies/employees and volunteer/charitable activities through our app, which efficiently connects them to local/global (paid-time off) volunteering events/activities that provide flexible scheduling and personal fulfillment of contributing to local communities.
      </p>
      <h4>Outline Solutions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Event Booking:</strong> Employees are able to choose from a list of charitable events and book themselves into the event
        </li> <br/>
        <li><strong>Event Chat Forum:</strong> Once an employee books an event, they are then able to chat to other event attendees in a chat room </li><br/>
        <li><strong>Company Profiles:</strong> Each company and charitable organization has a profile that we’d utilize to match recommended opportunities to corporations, and vice versa for volunteering organizations → efficiency in opportunity searches
        </li><br/>
      </ul>
      
    </section>
        <!--Uniqueness-->
    <section class="corporateUniqueness corporate-text"data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1500">
      <h2>Uniqueness of Solution </h2>
      <h4>Unique Value</h4>
      <p>We target small business corporations who don’t have the resources big companies do to host or sponsor (paid-leave) volunteer events. our target population is specific to companies who wish to contribute to civic engagement but don’t have the resources or flexible schedules to provide their employees these opportunities. </p>
    <h4>Unfair Advantage</h4>
    <p>Plan for innovation
      <br/>
      We provide personalized/customized experience for corporations, making it eaiser for them to plan their civic engagement goals and build spread their company culture to their community: Upon subscription, companies will fill out preferences (time, goals, and values), and we will use these preferences to build a customized package: guaranteed matched opportunities every month/week, provide ads + press attention for each event, communication chat forums to connect event organizers to companies directly, and more. Our idea allows for customization, something other competitors don’t have.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h3>What I have learned from the experience</h3>
     <p>I have learnt that working with an enitrely new team had it's challenges and that clear communication was needed. Each team member's role is important and clear duties should be given out beforehand in order to successfully complete a project.
      At the last hurdle we were unable to present a website as some communication was lacking, the website was only created weeks after the event. </p>
      <p> After the hackathon as I was proud of the concept and wanted to see how it would all work out, in the end. This was my first hackathon and having my idea be chosen by my team members and recieving validation from the judges was a great feeling and even though we did not make the finals. The whole experience of coming up with concepts within a short time frame and collaborating with team mates across the world was gripping to say the least and one that I throughly enjoyed.</p>
    
    <h3>Room for improvement</h3>
    <p>We could refine the end product to make it a more lucrative idea for corporations to collaborate with the company idea.</p>
    <p>The website itself is limited in the amount of capabilities, the brief was to provide a landing page that could provide an overall idea of the concept. I would like to improve on its functionality.</p>
    <p>I would like to increase the functionality of the app's ui and attempt to create a working app.</p>
