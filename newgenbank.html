      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        The banking app I created was to show how the user can have a simplified
        and easy banking experience. It could be the bench mark for how N.G.B
        could create, maintain and present future products and information to
        the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few shortfalls or limitations when looking at the banking
        sector; personal information authorization, money laundary laws,credit
        scores and much more. The app is to make the user's experience less
        formal (less jargon) and easy to use for simple banking actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working on this project was interesting for me as I have only considered
        local banking needs and I now had the opprtunity to explore what the
        needs of others needs are outside of South Africa. In the future I would
        like to build upon the app to include bitcoin and shares information and
        purchasing.
