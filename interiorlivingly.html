      <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <p>
        Interior Livingly is a blog that provides readers with short, easy to
        read blog posts that encompasses the latest trends that can be used
        within their individual spaces. The blog started on instagram with quick
        and easy to follow posts but wants to differentiate itself from other
        interior design blogs providing a little more to help readers create
        their own space. The blog wants to provide an AR experience to their
        readers. A website would be built that has blog posts and the ability
        for users to open up an AR function to place items from our catalogue
        into their spaces.
      </p>
      <h3>Research Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The objective is to explore the thought process of the readers when
        opting to redo a space and how they envision adding furnishings and
        furnishing to their space.
      </p>
      <h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &#10070;&nbsp;Learning what the thought process is of the reader when
          they decorate their space
        </li>
        <li>
          &#10070;&nbsp;What type of experience do they want to have when making
          purchases
        </li>
        <li>&#10070;&nbsp;How to make the experience as easy as possible</li>

        <small
          >All findings are more detailed and have been summarised for the
          portfolio</small
        >

        <h3>Findings From Online Research</h3>
        <p>
          AR is the future of customer shopping experience.Allowing customers to
          'try before you buy' without actually walking into a store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web AR is a simplified version of AR with its pro's and con's but
          allows for a broader range of users through web searches.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are not as many African/ South African based interior designer
          or furniture stores that provide AR experience to customers.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/OnlineFindings.png"
          class="researchMap"
          alt="mind map of findings"
        />
        <h3>Findings From Particpants</h3>
        <p>
          Once all the data was collected I then came to my conclusions was by
          splitting the data so that it could be easily measured by:
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantitative results are from close ended questions; yes and no or
          given participants options to choose from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qualitative results are from the patterns of responses from
          participants substantiating their responses. I could then group
          keywords and deduce themes from the findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall readers and potential readers of the blog came to a few
          conclusions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &#10070;&nbsp;They want easy and affordable/ free advice to style
            their homes.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#10070;&nbsp;They would like a shopping experience without leaving
            their homes but being assured of the product's accurate description.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#10070;&nbsp;They do not want to commit to apps that takes up space
            on their phones or any fees associated with the app.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img

    <!--User Persona-->
    <section class="interiorCenter">
      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <p>
        I created a user persona that matches the average, current reader of the
        blog.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/InteriorPersona.png"

    <!--Planning-->
    <section class="interiorCenter">
      <div>
        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>
          I first decided on what type of application to choose from which was:
          a website with a Web AR feature. The website would have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &#10070;&nbsp;The ability to host the blog articles and Web AR
            feature
          </li>
          <li>&#10070;&nbsp;Easy to access for new users</li>
          <li>
            &#10070;&nbsp;Less commitment, user would not have to download an
            app
          </li>
          <li>&#10070;&nbsp;No app store fees to host it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I decided to make it easy to use as most users either: do not use AR
          or have a low level knowledge of AR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Easy navigation for users, without too many features to complicate the
          user's experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photographs of furniture items would be converted from images to 3d
          models through the use of blender.
        </p>

      <div class="interiorWireframeDiv">
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <h3>Desktop Wireframe</h3>
        <p>
          The low fidelity desktop wireframe begins on the landing page of the
          site and branches off into other pages. Users will be able to access
          most of the site with the exception of the web AR feature.
        </p>
        <div class="interiorWireDiv">

        </ul>

        <h3>Mobile Wireframe</h3>
        <p>
          To access the web AR feature, the user would need to use a
          mobile/tablet.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        The next step is to pitch the idea to furniture stores and manufacturers
        to be able to advertise their products on the site.
      </p>
      <h3>My thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        The project was a great learning curve for me as it tested my research
        ability into a new customer market to explore. The concept has the
        potential to allow South African shoppers to explore a new way of
        purchasing furniture. Learning about Web AR and AR apps is a remarkable
        avenue and I intend on learning more about the potential use of it in
        everyday life.
